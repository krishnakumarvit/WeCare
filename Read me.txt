This project is made by Team - Hackin'IT during Hackoff 2.0 at Vit University.


Abstract:

WeCare is an IoT based project which provides real-time monitoring and immediate assistance to the patients.
 This project mainly consists of several microcontrollers which are working together along with various sensors
 to extract patient parameters like Heartrate, body-temperature and detects if anything wrong goes with the patient, 
along with the above mentioned this project also monitors the other parameters of the room where the patient is kept. 
In case of any emergency, the system is capable to call for help by sending text/email messages to the device of the caretaker. 
This system also provides real-time monitoring and storing the patient details for future medical needs. 
The components used in this project are Nodemcu microcontroller, DHT11, LM35 sensor, pulse ThingSpeak API. 
An app is also developed which will show all the parameters in real-time and the emergency notifications will also be received on the application.
